# Boston Income Analysis

This project explores income inequality across Boston neighborhoods using publicly available data. It compares a real-world regression model with an equity-focused model that omits racially coded features.

## Key Findings
- Income correlates strongly with race and poverty indicators.
- Removing race and related features drastically reduces predictive accuracy.
- Neighborhood-level disparities are visible just blocks apart.
